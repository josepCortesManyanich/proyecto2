            Born from the desire for natural solutions to the physical and mental stresses of our modern-day lifestyles, Chill&Pill is a wellness brand for the cannabis-curious. The universe of research around cannabis use is expanding every day, but here’s what we already know. Cannabidiol or CBD is one of 100 active compounds present in the cannabis plant and has proven extremely effective in managing stress and anxiety. It can provide relief from chronic pain, and improve both mood and appetite almost instantly. CBD can soothe skin inflammation, manage insulin levels or ease you into a restful night’s sleep. CBD is still not as widely-accessible or as commonly-consumed in India as you would think. We’re here to change that.
